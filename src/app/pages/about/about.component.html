      <p><span>Hello! </span>Iâ€™m Janira Gilarte.</p>
      <p>
        Since I can remember, I have always been interested in knowing in a deep way how things work and why. It did not matter if it was science, technology, art or human behavior, that my interest occupied my extra hours. That is why I decided to do a philosophy degree, where I learned to think and communicate, among other things. During this period I realized that knowing about how humans interpret things was something that I paid special attention to. In my last year I specialized in symbolism,  different perspectives, cultures and ways of thinking.<br><br>
        In a parallel way, the makeup, which I started as a hobby, ended up becoming a real work. Working as a makeup artist I learned many techniques and little by little I have improved in shadows, dimensions, harmony of colors and many other things. This has been a way to express my artistic part.<br><br>
        For me,  UX / UI design has meant the joint of all these passions. For two intense months I have had the privilege of learning from expert teachers and classmates at Ironhack, with whom it has been really enriching to work. I have learned about methods, tools, concepts, skills and ways of working.<br><br>
