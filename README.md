# Portfolio

<!-- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Contribute

### Clone the repo

Download the repo if you didn't do it before by cloning it like:

`git clone https://github.com/palancana/jani-portfolio.git`

And run `cd jani-portfolio` to enter into the cloned repo folder.

### Install dependencies

While the source code is now downloaded, all the small packages that the code needs are not downloaded nor installed. This makes the code easier to download. To install all these packages (dependencies) run:

`npm install` which is the same as `npm i`

### Launch a live example with hot reload

If you run `ng serve` an example of the webpage will run on a localhost port. It should be `http://localhost:4200`, you will see the URL once you launch the command. 

After this, just open your favorite code editor and open the project folder. Make changes. When you save your changes, the webpage will automagically update!

## What to change

Inside the `src/app` folder, there is the components and pages folder. Inside them there are each page or component with a name and inside it 4 files: two JS, one HTML and one CSS. Forget about JS and focus on the other two.

The pages folders with project names are the ones that you can edit.

## Upload the changes

Create a new branch
`git checkout -b feature/name-your-branch-here-with-something-meaningful`
Commit and push your changes when you've done something remarkable. Try not to make only one commit.
```
git add .
git commit -m "Message with what you've done"
git push
```

The first time you do a push in a new branch it will tell you something like: untracked changes on remote, run `git -set-upstream-branch bla bla bla`... Do that and... voil√†.
